# Improvements

As I dont have much time after work (i have part time work too) I would spend more time making the app more user friendly. Making sure the menu looks nicer and the experience is smoother
I would make the code easier to read by adding comments and white space
In future versions I will try using intermediate principles of java to make the code neater.
